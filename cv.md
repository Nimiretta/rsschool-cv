### Code Examples
##### DESCRIPTION:
 An anagram is the result of rearranging the letters of a word to produce a new word (see wikipedia).

 Note: anagrams are case insensitive

 Complete the function to return true if the two arguments given are anagrams of each other; return false otherwise.

##### Examples
 - `"foefet"` is an anagram of `"toffee"`
 - `"Buckethead"` is an anagram of `"DeathCubeK"`

 ```JavaScript
 // write the function isAnagram
 var isAnagram = function(test, original) {
   if (test.length !== original.length) {
         return false;
     }
 
     const testArr = test.toLowerCase().split('').sort();
     const originalArr = original.toLowerCase().split('').sort();
 
     for (let i = 0; i < testArr.length; i++) {
         if (testArr[i] !== originalArr[i]) {
             return false;
         }
     }
 
     return true;
 };
 ```
